    I am a researcher with the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/multispeech/">Multispeech team</a> at <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en">Inria</a>, Nancy - Grand Est, France. My current research focuses on robust audio-visual speech processing (enhancement & separation), with an emphasis on combining the expressive power of deep neural networks with statistical and probabilistic machine learning techniques, e.g., using deep generative models.

    I received my PhD from <a href="https://en.sharif.edu">Sharif University of Technology</a>, Tehran, Iran, in April 2018. From August 2018 to October 2020, I was a postdoctoral researcher with the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/perception/">Perception team</a> at Inria, Grenoble, France, working with <a href="https://team.inria.fr/perception/team-members/radu-patrice-horaud/">Radu Horaud</a> and <a href="http://xavirema.eu">Xavier Alameda-Pineda</a>. Prior to that, I was a visiting PhD scholar at the Information Science and
    Engineering Department, <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)</a>, Stockholm, Sweden, and later, a research engineer at the Automatic Control Department.
